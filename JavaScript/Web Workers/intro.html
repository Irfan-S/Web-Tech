    - Web workers are background scripts, and are heavy-weight.
    - When a script is executing inside a Web Worker, it cannot access the window and DOM API
    Syntax:
        - var worker = new Worker('task.js')
        Start by calling: worker.postMesssage()
    
    Methods:
        var worker = new Worker('ble.js')
        - worker.postMessage() <- can pass in a string or JSON object as argument.
        - worker.terminate() <- to terminate a worker from main page
        - self.close() <- to terminate the worker from within itself.
        - onmessage() <- inside the worker, starts it up when postMessage() is called from the worker object.
