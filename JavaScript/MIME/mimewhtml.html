<!--
    MIME handles data transmission such as completed HTML forms from browser to server.

    For forms, we use multipart/form-data.
        - Delimited by a string started with '--'.
        - Each part is its own entity w own HTTP headers, 'Content-Disposition', and 'Content-Type'
        - multipart/byteranges type is used to send partial responses to browser.

    Unrecognized resources are saved as application/octet-stream. Most browsers don't load these resources, and require that they be saved on disk before use, for security reasons.

    vnd -> Vendor specific subtype.
    Example : application/vnd-somecompany-datatype
